## 🎯 Purpose

This organization serves as an **academic archive** of selected projects completed throughout my studies.  
While some repositories are missing (either lost or stored on physical backups), the projects listed here represent a significant part of my progress in:

- **Algorithm design and data structures**
    
- **Software development in Java, C, Dart, and Flutter**
    
- **Object-oriented programming and system-level coding**
    
- **Applied problem-solving and system optimization**
